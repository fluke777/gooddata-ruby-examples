=== Adding user to project from organization (domain)
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You have users added in organization (domain). You would like to add them into the project.

==== Prerequisites
You have to have a user who is an admin of an organization. If you do not have that please consult support to get one.
Works only with 0.6.12 and higher

==== Solution

[source,ruby]
----
require 'gooddata'

client = GoodData.connect

# Get your domain ..
domain = client.domain('domain_name')
project = client.projects('project_id')

# Let's get all users except of ourselves
users_to_add = domain.users.reject { |u| u.login != client.user.login }

# Let's add all as viewer
users_to_add.each { |u| project.add_user(u, 'Viewer', domain: domain) }
