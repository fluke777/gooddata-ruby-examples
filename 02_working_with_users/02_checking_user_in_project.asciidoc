=== Checking user in project
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You would like to see if a user is part of a project.

==== Prerequisites
You have to have a user who is an admin of an organization. If you do not have that please consult support to get one.

==== Solution

[source,ruby]
----
# encoding: utf-8

require 'gooddata'

GoodData.with_connection('user', 'password') do |client|
  GoodData.with_project('project_pid') do |project|
    project.member?('jane.doe@example.com')
  end
end

----

==== Discussion

You can ask on membership not just by login but also check an object. This might be useful especially if you check a user from several projects.
