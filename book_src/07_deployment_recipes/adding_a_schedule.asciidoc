=== Adding a schedule to a deployed process
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You have a process deployed but you would like to add a schedule to it so the process is executed regularly

==== Solution
You can easily add a time based schedule to any process. There are couple of advantages to a schedule as compared to a process. Schedule executions are logged and logs are kept around for some time (~10 days). Also schedule keeps list of parameters so you create it once and you do not need to care about them anymore.

GoodData.with_connection do |client|
  project = GoodData.use('project_id')
  process = project.deploy_process('./hello_world.rb',
                                   type: :ruby,
                                   name: "example_process")
  process.create_schedule('0 15 * * *', 'hello_world.rb', params: { param1: 'a', param2: 'b' })
end
