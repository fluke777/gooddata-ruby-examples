=== Quickly setting simple Data filter

by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You would like to set a User filter for one or two users. It can be a one off.

==== Solution
SDK offers couple of convenience features for doing this. Let's first recap what we need to set up a filter.

In this case we will be setting a simple filter in a general shape of

  WHERE city IN (san francisco, prague, amsterdam)

* We need to know the values we wold like to set. In our case that is (san francisco, prague, amsterdam)
* We need to know what label these values are related to. In our case city
* We also need to know which user you would like to assign this filter. In this case use yourself or any other user that you like.

Although we present this as an executable script this is something that is best done interactively so do not fear to jack in to a project and follow along.
