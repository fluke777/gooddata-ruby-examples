=== Working with HR Demo project
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
I would like to play with blueprints but I cannot come up with some data and model of a ptoy project. Can you give me any?

==== Solution

Yes. Use our HR example which models a small company and people inside it. We tried to use majority of the features that the blueprint builder supports so you can take it as a starting point when you are creating yours.
