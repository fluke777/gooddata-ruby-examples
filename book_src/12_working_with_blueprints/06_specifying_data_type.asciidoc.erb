=== Specifying data type in the blueprint
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You would like to specify a different data type in a blueprint

==== Solution

Each column in blueprint is eventually translated into a physical column in a database. While the defaults are typically what you want sometimes it might be useful to override them. You can specify the data type with gd_data_type clause.

<%= render_ruby 'src/12_working_with_blueprints/updating_project_1.rb' %>

==== Discussion

Data types that are supported are for facts

DECIMAL(m, d)
INTEGER
LONG

and for attributes
VARCHAR(n)

The case where this is very useful are

- if you use values from smaller domain (for example small integers) you can leverage appropriate data type to save space and speed things up
- if you are using number with atypical precision - the default is DECIMAL(12,2)
- sometimes it might be good
