=== Specifying data type in the blueprint
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You would like to specify a different data type in a blueprint

==== Solution

Each column in blueprint is eventually translated into a physical column in a database. While the defaults are typically what you want sometimes it might be useful to override them. You can specify the data type with gd_data_type clause.

<%= render_ruby 'src/12_working_with_blueprints/specifying_datatype.rb' %>

==== Discussion

These data types that are supported on the platform

- DECIMAL(m, d)
- INTEGER
- LONG
- VARCHAR(n)

The case where this is very useful are

- if you use values from smaller domain (for example integers) you can leverage appropriate data type to save space and speed things up
- if you are using facts with atypical precision (the default is DECIMAL(12,2)) you can leverage decimal type with larger precision
