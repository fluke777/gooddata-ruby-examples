=== Refactoring datasets
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You created a quick protoype but you found out that it needs some touch ups.

==== Notes
This is work in progress.

==== Solution

Use SDK refactoring features.

Let's have a look at two hypothetical but very common scenarios that you probably encountered in during career.

"One Dataset problem"

Lets' say you have model like this

<%= render_ruby 'src/12_working_with_blueprints/refactoring_part1.rb' %>

There is one problem. We should definitely extract the attribute from 'dataset.sales' dataset somewhere else. Also the anchor for this dataset has a lable. Unless we do not have specific reson for it we should extract it somewhere else.

We can try to ask SDK to help us

refactored_blueprint = blueprint.refactor_split_df('dataset.sales')

Let's have a look around

<%= render_ruby 'src/12_working_with_blueprints/refactoring_part2.rb' %>

You can see that there is stage attribute right there. And it prepared an anchor for us. The naming definitely needs touch ups (User should be able to specify the ids somehow). Now let's have a alook what happened to sales dataset

<%= render_ruby 'src/12_working_with_blueprints/refactoring_part3.rb' %>

You can see that the attribute is gone with labels. Only facts remained. New reference was added so the reports should still be working. This might seems just like a minor thing but once you start creating more complex models with multiple stars you find this tqchnique a necessity so why not automate it. 

Another problem we will look at is splitting fact tables because of facts. Conside this model

<%= render_ruby 'src/12_working_with_blueprints/refactoring_part4.rb' %>

What you want to do is have a look at how many shipments were ordered and shipped on particular day. But if you keep the facts in one dataset you will have all kinds of trouble with nil values. Much better is to split the fact tables in two.

<%= render_ruby 'src/12_working_with_blueprints/refactoring_part5.rb' %>

These are 2 basic ways how to refactor a blueprint in an assisted and automated fashion.
