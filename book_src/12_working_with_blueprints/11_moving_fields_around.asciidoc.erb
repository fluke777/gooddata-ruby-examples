=== Moving fields in blueprint
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
I created a model and now found out that I would like to move a field to different dataset.

==== Solution
We will use variation of our hr demo model. If you look at that model you can see that we have an attribute *region* defined on departments dataset. This is how you (hypothetically) originally created the project and everything was fine but you realized that you would like to assign the region to people dataset not departments dataset.

Before we start changing things spin up the project go inside the project and create a report which show *SUM(Amount)* broken by *Region*. 

Now let's move the attribute between datasets.
<%= render_ruby 'src/12_working_with_blueprints/moving_fields_around_part1.rb' %>

Since we moved the attribute we have to load new data for it in the context of new dataset. The old dataset (departments) is fine since we just removed a column.

<%= render_ruby 'src/12_working_with_blueprints/moving_fields_around_part2.rb' %>

Now go ahead and check the original report. Yes, it is still working fine. It gives different numbers since we changed the meaning of it but we did not break anything.
