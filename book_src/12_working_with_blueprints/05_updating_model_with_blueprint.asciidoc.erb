=== Updating a project with blueprint
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You would like to update a project with additional fields

==== Solution

Blueprints are easy to create programmatically and even to merge them together. In this example we will create a simple blueprint with one dataset and then add an additional field into blueprint and update the model.

<%= render_ruby 'src/12_working_with_blueprints/updating_project_1.rb' %>

==== Discussion

In the example above we have created a new model and updated it right away. This is not a typical situation however and there are couple of things that you need to be aware of.

It is more common that you would like to gradually update the model in an existing project as the new requirements arrive. For that to be possible you have to take the "old" blueprint from some place where it is persisted. We will show a basic way how to save a blueprint to a file.

<%= render_ruby 'src/12_working_with_blueprints/updating_project_2.rb' %>
