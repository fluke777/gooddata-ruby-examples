=== Changing number formatting of a metric

by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You have a project and you would like to update formatting of all metrics programatically. They are currently formatted for dollars but you would like to change this to Euros.

==== Solution

[source,ruby]
----
# encoding: utf-8

require 'gooddata'

client = GoodData.connect
project = client.projects(PROJECT_ID)
project.metrics.pmap do |metric|
  metric.content['format'] = metric.content['format'].gsub('$', 'â‚¬')
  metric.save
end
