=== Removing data from dataset(s)
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
Sometimes you need to get rid of the data in project. SDK allows to do it quickly and elegantly.

==== Solution
What happens underneath is that you can call a MAQL expression along the lines of

  SYNCHRONIZE {dataset.users};

for each dataset you would like to clear. You can achieve the same like this.

[source,ruby]

# encoding: utf-8

require 'gooddata'

client = GoodData.connect
project = client.projects('project_id')

# You can select the dataset in several ways
dataset = project.datasets.find {|d| d.title == 'Users'}
dataset = project.datasets('dataset.users')
dataset = project.datasets(345)
dataset.delete_data
# dataset.synchronize works as well
