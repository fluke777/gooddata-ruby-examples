=== Working with folders
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You would like to use folders in your model to help dlarity on UI 

==== Solution

By default all the attributes and facts are automatically assigned a folder based on name of the dataset. This name is either generated from name or the title is used if defined. You can also override this and specify its own folder for particular field.

require 'gooddata'

client = GoodData.connect

blueprint = GoodData::Model::ProjectBlueprint.build("my_bp") do |p|
  p.add_dataset('sales_reps', title: 'Awesome Sales Reps') do |d|
    d.add_anchor('id')
    d.add_attribute('name')
  end

  p.add_dataset('regions') do |d|
    d.add_anchor('id')
    d.add_attribute('name')
  end
  
  p.add_dataset('opportunities') do |d|
    d.add_fact('amount', folder: 'My Special Folder')
    d.add_reference('sales_rep_id', dataset: 'sales_reps')
    d.add_reference('region_id', dataset: 'regions')
  end
end

project = client.create_project_from_blueprint(blueprint, auth_token: 'token_id')

# Currently there is not support in SDK to directly explore folders but we can reach to API directly
# You can also go to the project in your browser and look for folders there
client.get("#{project.md['query']}/dimensions")['query']['entries'].map {|i| i['title']} # => ["Sales Reps", "Regions", "Opportunities"]

client.get("#{project.md['query']}/folders")['query']['entries'].map {|i| i['title']} # => ["My Special Folder"]

==== Discussion

One thing to note is that folders are not removed if you would publish a model where a previously used folder would stay empty.
