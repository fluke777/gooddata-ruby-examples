=== Redeploying an existing process programmatically
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You would like to redeploy a CloudConnect or Ruby process to GoodData platform.

==== Solution
SDK allows you a nice shorthand for redeploying a process all you have to do is to get a handle on the process. Here we are using hypothetical process id, but you can use any traditional way to get a process. Take note that the same deployment rules as in `project.deploy_process` apply. You can deploy a directory file or a compressed package.

[source,ruby]
----
# encoding: utf-8

require 'gooddata'

client = GoodData.connect
project = client.projects('project_id')
process = project.processes('process_id')
process.deploy('path_to_your_process')
